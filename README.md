----------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT----------------------------------------------------

Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Iris Dataset

Objective:

The objective of this project was to gain a deep understanding of the Iris dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This involved uncovering the data's characteristics, distributions, relationships between variables, and potential outliers to inform further analysis and decision-making.

Methodologies used:

•	The Iris dataset was loaded using pandas.

•	Data characteristics were explored by examining the first few rows and data types.

•	Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were performed to understand the central tendency, spread, and relationships between numerical features (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width).

•	Boxplots were created to identify potential outliers in the data.

•	Visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and a correlation matrix heatmap provided  insights into data distributions and feature relationships

Findings:

•	The EDA revealed summary statistics for each numerical feature, highlighting central tendency (mean, median) and spread (standard deviation).

•	The correlation matrix identified potential relationships between features, which can be further investigated.

•	Boxplots aided in detecting potential outliers, requiring further analysis or justification.

•	Histograms and scatter plots visually displayed the distributions and relationships between features.
